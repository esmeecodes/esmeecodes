### Hi there 🙋🏼‍♀️, my name is Esmée.

# 💬 Who is Esmée? 
I'm a Creative 'firestarter', who loves learning new things every day and integrates these experiences into creating inspiring ideas and solutions. Although I love to be in that flow, I also appreciate to stop, detach and observe things from a distance. However, challenging the status quo is something I'll never stop doing.


🌱 Currently I'm creating an web-app called YearlyCompass ✨ to practice creating a fullstack app with the MERN stack

🐝 When not creating magic with code, I'm busy working out, unfolding the world while traveling, trying out new brunchspots, reading about personal development and/or dancing to electronic music.

💁🏼‍♀️ Fun fact: My given name, Esmée (pronounced as: as-may) is short for Esmeralda. My passport says Esmeralda, but it's only used as an official name.
