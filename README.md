### Hi there 🙋🏼‍♀️, my name is Esmée.. looks like you've found my Github profile!

💬 Who is Esmée? 
I'm a Creative 'firestarter', who loves learning new things every day and integrates these experiences into creating inspiring ideas and solutions. My scope in one sentence: I create and work on webapplications (frontend and backend) with Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJs, ExpressJs, React, Bootstrap, and I am starting with Typescript as well. 

🌱 Currently I'm creating an web-app called YearlyCompass to practice creating a fullstack app with the MERN stack  ✨

🐝 When not creating magic with code, I'm busy working out, unfolding the world while traveling, trying out new brunchspots, reading about personal development and/or dancing to electronic music.

💁🏼‍♀️ Fun fact: My given name, Esmée (pronounced as: es-may) is short for Esmeralda. My passport says Esmeralda, but it's only used as an official name.
